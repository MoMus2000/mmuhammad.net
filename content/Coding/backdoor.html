<pre><h2><strong>How backdoors work on computers ...</strong></h2></pre>
<pre><h6><strong>By Mustafa Muhammad</strong></h6></pre>
<pre><h3>
In this article I will discuss backdoors, especially from the perspective of web developers who are well experienced with the server client architecture.
</h3></pre>
<pre><strong>I would like to stress that the following article is for learning only and I do not accept any liability if the reader uses the gained knowledge for malicious purposes.</strong></pre>
<pre><h3>
Let us first discuss what a backdoor is:
</h3><h3>
A backdoor is a program that allows an unauthorized user to gain control of your system with out the user or system being aware of it. Usually backdoors are utilized for malicious perposes hence are also commonly referred to as a trojan virus.
</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>These backdoors are typically found bundled into software that from a bird's eye view look pretty safe out of the box.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>Most of us developers rely on open source code to cut down on development time and prevent reinventing the wheel from scratch, however there is a level of trust involved when using these libraries of code found on the internet.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>What makes it scary is if the libraries that we usually trust to be safe conatiner a backdoor that would be added into our code upon building/compiling the project.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>A pretty well known example of this is the ken thompson hack, it talks about adding in backdoor into a C compiler, this would mean that every compiled C binary would contain a backdoor to be able to accessed by the attacker/unauthorized user.</h3></pre>
<pre><h2>How does a backdoor work?</h2></pre>
