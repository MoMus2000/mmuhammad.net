<pre><h2><strong>How backdoors work on computers ...</strong></h2></pre>
<pre><h6><strong>By Mustafa Muhammad</strong></h6></pre>
<pre><h3>In this write up I will discuss backdoors, especially from my perspective as a web developer who is experienced with the client - server architecture.
</h3></pre>
<pre><strong>I would like to stress that the following article is for learning only and I do not accept any liability if the reader misuses gained knowledge for malicious purposes.</strong></pre>
<pre><h3>
Let us first discuss what a backdoor is:</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>A backdoor is a program that allows an unauthorized user to gain control of your system without the user or system being aware of it. Usually backdoors are utilized for malicious purposes hence are also commonly referred to as the trojan virus.
</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>Essentially its shell/terminal access gained by an attacker operating from a Command and Control (C&C) server.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>These backdoors are typically found bundled into software that from a bird's eyeview look pretty safe out of the box.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>A pretty ingenious example involving the use of backdoors is the <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?TheKenThompsonHack"> Ken Thompson Hack.</a></h3></pre>
<pre><h3>It involves adding malicious code inside of a compiler, which will proceed to write backdoors into all the binaries that are created using it.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3></h3></pre>
<pre><h2>How does a backdoor work?</h2></pre>

<pre>A graphic that explains the architecture involved in a backdoor</pre>
<pre><h3>So how would one write this in code ?</h3></pre>
<pre><h6><ol><li>Create a slave server and client server.</li><li>The client server would be programmed to listen to incoming connections.</li><li>The slave server would try and connect to the the client (C&C) machine.</li><li>Once the connection is establised, the possibilities are only limited to the what was programmed onto the slave server before being planted in the victim PC.</li></ol></h6>
</pre><pre><h3>Why does this work?</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>While firewalls typically block unrequested incoming traffic, in the case of a backdoor the slave server is the one that initiates the request hence the request is conidered to be legitimate and is allowed to go through.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>Programming languages like python, GO, etc. provide the ability to run shell commands via their standard library (os), hence these are mostly used to control the victim PC.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>While the steps in creating a backdoor may seem easy, the hard part is being able to plant malicous code into the victim computer. This leads to the famous phrase "Humans being the weakest link in the cyber security chain", since attackers will try to exploit humans via social engineering to accomplish their malicious agenda.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>In conclusion here are some helpful tips to avoid falling victim to a trojan virus:</h3></pre>
<pre><h6><ol><li>Vetting the files that you download from the internet.</li><li>Monitor your running processes to see if there's anything unexpected, the same goes for checking the network to see some anomalous requests originating from your computer.</li></ol></h6></pre>
