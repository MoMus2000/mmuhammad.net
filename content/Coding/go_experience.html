<pre><h2><strong>Initial experience and thoughts using Go(Golang) ...</strong></h2></pre>
<pre><h6><strong>By Mustafa Muhammad</strong></h6></pre>    
<pre><h3>Go is one of the many languages that I'd been itching to learn since the past year. I recently decided to take the plunge and write my personal site using Go(Golang).</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>In this write up I talk about some of the features that I loved working with on Go and the things that can hopefully be fixed and improved in future releases for the language.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>Transitioning over from python to Go, was super simple. Writing Go felt very similar to C, but upgraded to address the needs of the modern programmer. I found dealing with pointers to be much simpler and intuitive compared to C as well.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3>Some of the things that I've enjoyed about the language:</h3></pre>
<pre><h3><strong>Static Typing:</strong></h3></pre>
<pre><h3>Transitioning over from python, static typing had been one of the more stand out features of Go. It felt much easier to read through code and the IDE was always ready to complain if there were type mismatches or related errors.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3><strong>Write once, run anywhere:</strong></h3></pre>
<pre><h3>I liked that Go is a compiled language, the compiler helped to pick out bugs that would have easily gone though and crashed the app during execution in interpreted languages like python. I also liked the cross compilation functionality that allowed me to compile my Go webapp as a single linux binary on my Mac and deploy it onto my online VM server.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3><strong>Easy to use standard library:</strong></h3></pre>
<pre><h3>The standard library had pretty much everything needed to get the webapp and services quickly up and running. I also found the templating engine to be easy to pick up and I used it extensively to built up the frontend functionality for my personal site.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3><strong>Goroutines:</strong></h3></pre>
<pre><h3>Go skips the boilerplate code found in languages like Java and C to create threads. To launch a function on a separate thread all you need to do is attach the "go" keyword before calling the function.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3><strong>Faster Execution:</strong></h3></pre>
<pre><h3>With execution speeds comparable to Java and C#, Go is a step ahead of interpreted languages like python and javascript when trying to accomplish computationally intensive tasks, while keeping syntax simple and straight forward.</h3></pre>
<pre><h3><strong>However I would not consider everything to be sunshine and rainbows with Go:</strong></h3></pre>
<pre><h3><li>The dependency management system is considered to be half baked or broken by many. When it works, it works great however when it doesn't you quickly realize that it's too fragile.</li></h3></pre>
<pre><h3><li>It's still a young language that hasn't found its niche. While javascript dominates the frontend, and python reigns over all things data, the best use of the functionality provided by Go is still unclear.</li></h3></pre>
<pre><h3><li>While being designed to be used for web based tasks, it is especially painful to work with JSON in Go.</li></h3></pre>
