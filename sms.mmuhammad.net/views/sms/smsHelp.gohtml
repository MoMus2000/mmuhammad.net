    <h5 class="mt-3"> Is the first month free ? </h5>
    <h5>Yes, I will waive my service fee charges for the first month, customers will only have to pay for the SMS they sent out.</h5>
    <h5 class="mt-3"> Is there a character limit on the total size of the message ? </h5>
    <h5> Yes, currently there is a limit of 160 characters to keep the costs to a minimum and enable the maximum number of messages to be sent with your loaded balance.
    <h5 class="mt-3"> Are we allowed to use special characters like emojis and "+" in the sent messages ? </h5>
    <h5> Yes, you are free to use special characters, but please note that using special characters may increase the size of your total message beyond 160 characters, increasing your cost per message sent. If you wish to keep costs low, do not use any special characters. If you're still unsure please consult with the admin and he will help.</h5>
